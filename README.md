Platform browser is type of a web browser for interacting with multisided markets. 

This repository will be for specification of the concept and [Asema](https://github.com/pekkabyte/asema) for its implementation, named after the Finnish word for "station". As a platform browser can be seen as a railway station housing platform(s) that connect people on different sides of a market running on parallel tracks, so I figured the name would fit well.
